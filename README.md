HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor
## Completed Tasks

This is an example of an on-the-job ticket where I modify code. 
Some modifications I made include adding comments and finding and fixing bugs and removing no longer needed classes of code after refactoring.

Web accessibility is very important for businesses and consumers. It helps businesses reach an audience that they otherwise cannot reach with their website. It helps consumers with disabilities access a website using technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making websites more accessible also helps companies about litigations that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website. A website being more accessible is better positioned in search engines like Google. 

The accessibility criteria is given below for the assignment. An important part of the assignment is to take existing code and refactor it. In this homework, it is implied that a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an exsisting side to make it more accessible.

The tech lead has given a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented below in the Acceptance Criteria.

**Important**: An important rule I followed when working with someone else's code is the **Scout Rule**, which recommends that you always leave the code cleaner than when you found it.

To impress clients, I made sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, I reworked the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and also including comments before elements or sections of the page.


## Criteria and backstory

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I 
    view the source code
  THEN I 
      find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I 
    view the structure of the HTML elements
  THEN I 
      find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I 
    view the image elements
  THEN I 
      find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I 
    view the heading attributes
  THEN 
      they fall in sequential order

WHEN I 
    view the title element
  THEN I 
      find a concise, descriptive title

```

## Usage
Clicking the link takes you to a small description of what it is.
